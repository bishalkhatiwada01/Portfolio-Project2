                <h2>My approach on the web development project</h2>
                <p>Getting started with this project was quite a challenge for me.
                  It was intimidating, but i decided to calm down and make plan.
                  I had vision of this portfolio building project. so i wrote it
                  down and finally had it. and then i studied on what was possible
                  with my user interface and how to give it looks. i decided to
                  go simple in terms of looks. However, the responsive part was
                  on big puzzle for me in the beginning. I have further written 
                  about this in next blog.

                <h2>Learning and Applying HTML and its Elements</h2>
                <p>My approach on making a five page website was like this:
                  I divided my tasks into five different segment, and started
                  off with one. I had problems with few of the HTML elements and
                  it's default value. So i went to W3School and learned about those
                  default value. I also got to learn about layering images and
                  icons and keep it inside same div with same class name and 
                  further desiging with CSS which i have written about in my third
                  blog. </p>

                <h2>Integrating CSS Grid display and column property</h2>
                <p>CSS grid property is a CSS property that offers a grid-based 
                  layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to 
                  design web pages without floats and positioning. The grid-
                  template-columns property defines the size (width) of each 
                  column in the grid layout. Whereas, The CSS Grid Layout 
                  Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, 
                  making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats
                  and positioning.</p>
