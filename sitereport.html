                    <p>In this entry of Site report, I will be reporting about my journey
                        i have experienced so far. The assignment was preety intimidating
                        at first but then I decided to make plan and follow. So, the 
                        workflow of my module was that I followed Divide and Conquer rule
                        which proved quite useful. I divided my tasks into smaller bits
                        and began executing it. At first phase i did research on HTML
                        elements and CSS grid property as i was not familiar with this.
                        I also made raw User interface in my notebook and decided to
                        follow it. I decided what components to add or remove in those 
                        five pages i.e. index.html, Portfolio.html, Contact.html, blog.html
                        and sitereport.html. So the process was quite legthy and code
                        were repeated. I also got to learn about "Do not repeat yourself".
                        so the container containing other html elements were same model
                        for almost every pages, which helped reducing lines of code. 
                        I was not able to design as i had thought in the beginning and i was
                        frustrated at times but then I followed the CSS box model. Inspect
                        element option was very helpful. I could track the div and sections
                        and what their sizes were. Styling was a bit hastle as well. I 
                        got to learn about CSS display, position and animation. Grid 
                        display was totally new to me so I researched about it. I have always
                        been fascinated by CSS animation but never got to learn it. so 
                        i learned basics of text animation which i implemented on heading
                        of the index.html file. Other things were images and styling
                        it with CSS.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p1">
                        So to conclude this, I followed divided and conquer model.
                        I learned basics of HTML CSS and animation on CSS. Its properties
                        were quite amazing. Display grid property, positioning and images.

                        Making decisions for User interface of the site was challenging.
                        i researched many portfolio websites in the internet. It will be
                        true to say that i was inspired by such designs but i decided to 
                        keep it simple in terms of user interface design. there are many 
                        components of user interface that would make difference. components
                        such as Font family, style, sizes and even font weight. When and where
                        to use. besides font there are major components such as background colours etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I decided to go with Poppins font family because Poppins is one of the Geometric 
                        sans serif typefaces have been a popular design tool for building websites. Each 
                        letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints 
                        where necessary to maintain an even typographic color. this font is great for both 
                        headlines and paragraph copy to improve readability and style. I used <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=Poppins">Google fonts</a>
                        to import and apply this font. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And as for the Colours, I used different colours as i was developing.
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://coolors.co/palettes/trending">coolors.co</a> is one specific site that helped me for awesome colour palette.
                        I used the color property in CSS to style the text colours whereas,
                        background-color is used for formating background colour of the page, 
                        section or a div. Besides this I have also used icons and <a target="_blank" href="https://icons8.com/icons">icons8</a> website was
                        go to place for me as there are many icons. same icons with different
                        size. so the variety offered in this website was very nice.
                    </p>
